Parquet for reducing Order fallouts

#1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Statement
"Order fallouts in telecom can be caused by payment failures, address mismatches, inventory issues, or API timeouts. These failures lead to revenue loss and poor customer experience. Our goal is to use historical fallout data stored in Parquet, apply Machine Learning (ML) to identify root causes, and predict potential failures before they occur."

#2Ô∏è‚É£ Why Use Parquet?
"We are dealing with high-volume, structured data (orders, failure reasons, timestamps, customer segments). Parquet is the best storage format because:"
‚úÖ Columnar storage ‚Üí Faster ML feature extraction
‚úÖ Compression ‚Üí Reduces storage cost
‚úÖ Predicate pushdown ‚Üí Efficient querying for ML preprocessing

#3Ô∏è‚É£ Solution Architecture
üî• End-to-End Flow for Root Cause Analysis
1Ô∏è‚É£ Store fallout data in Parquet (Partitioned by Date & Region)
2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering ‚Üí Extract meaningful insights from order failures
3Ô∏è‚É£ Train a Classification Model ‚Üí Predict the most likely failure cause
4Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy Model for Real-Time Predictions
